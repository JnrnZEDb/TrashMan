Garbage NZB finder and tracker

This application is an intermediary which interfaces with SABnzbd+ and SickBeard to find
and filter NZB's which are password protected or otherwise not what they claim to be.

NZB's are flagged with a comment on any NewsNab provider (provided you've got permission
and comments are allowed) and the comments are searched to validate before downloading
begins.
